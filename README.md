# jutla-cv

First version created on 12/27/17.

My academic CV, based on [latextemplates.com's modified version](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/wilson-resume-cv) of [Howard Wilson's template](https://github.com/watsonbox/cv_template_2004).

3 versions:
- LaTeX vanilla format (`jutla_cv.tex` + `structure.tex`)
- Markdown vanilla format (`jutla_cv.md`)
- LaTeX CUMC format (`jutla_cv_cumc.tex` + `structure_cumc.tex`)

The LaTeX versions are for `PDF` output; I (inconsistently) maintain the Markdown version in case I need `doc`/`docx.` (I haven't been able to find a way to convert LaTeX to Word that doesn't involve a lot of painful manual cleanup.)

For now, I update these versions manually, in parallel.

To do:
- Consolidate `structure.tex` and `structure_cumc.tex` into one file.
- Build a generic (yaml?) template to obviate need for parallel versions.

# jutla-cv

Created 12/27/17

My academic CV, based on [latextemplates.com's modified version](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/wilson-resume-cv) of [Howard Wilson's template](https://github.com/watsonbox/cv_template_2004).

3 versions:
- LaTeX vanilla format (`jutla_cv.tex` + `structure.tex`)
- Markdown vanilla format (`jutla_cv.md`)
- LaTeX CUMC format (`jutla_cv_cumc.tex` + `structure_cumc.tex`)

The LaTeX versions are for PDF output; I maintain the Markdown version in case I need doc/docx. I haven't been able to find a way to convert LaTeX to Word that doesn't involve a lot of painful manual cleanup.

Someday I want to build a generic (yaml?) template that I can process into whichever file and/or document format I need. For now, I update these versions manually, in parallel.

To do:
- Consolidate `structure.tex` and `structure_cumc.tex` into one file.

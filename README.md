# jutla-cv

Created 12/27/17

My academic CV, based on [latextemplates.com's modified version](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/wilson-resume-cv) of [Howard Wilson's template](https://github.com/watsonbox/cv_template_2004).

3 versions:
- LaTeX vanilla format
- Markdown vanilla format
- LaTeX CUMC format

Someday I want to build a generic (yaml?) template that I can process into whichever file and/or document format I need. For now, I update these versions manually, in parallel.
